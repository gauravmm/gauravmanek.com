title: 3D Printing

I recently bought a Solidoodle 2 3D printer.

# 3D Models

Some of the models I've made are available on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/gauravmm/collections).

# Customizations

## Walls

I superglued [small neodymium magnets](http://www.dx.com/p/super-strong-rare-earth-re-magnets-8mm-20-pack-4248) to 12" by 12" by 1/16" lexan sheets to build removable walls for the printer.

Adding these walls substantially reduced warping, improving the print quality.

## Base Plate

The regular baseplate is not sufficiently flat to prevent warping. I use a 6" by 6" by 1/4" glass sheet clipped onto the metal baseplate. Aluminum foil (between the baseplate and the glass sheet) is used to keep the bed flat and level.

I use either multiple layers of hairspray or an ABS/Acetone slurry as the binding agent.
