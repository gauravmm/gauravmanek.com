Over the years, I have built up Linux administration skills. Most recently, I have applied them to develop the Locus Lab's internal GPU cluster.

For other groups looking to set up their own GPU clusters, I have written a [cluster roadmap](/blog/2017/designing-a-cluster/) that provides a guide on scaling from nothing to a $250k cluster as well as some tips and tricks on [configuring a cluster](/blog/2018/configuring-a-cluster/).

I am currently maintaining Locus Lab's GPU cluster and training others in server managment and maintenance.
