subtitle: Web design after three years.

This website has been redesigned from the ground-up, after lying dormant for many years. The new website is better-designed, leverages modern techniques in web development and has room for expansion.

Documentation and source code is available [on github](https://github.com/gauravmm/gauravmanek.com/). I have also written about some of the tools and techniques that I used to build this site:

- [Building with Gulp](/blog/2014/building-with-gulp/)
- [Making websites faster](/blog/2014/faster-websites/)
- [Templating with Jekyll](/blog/2014/templating-with-jeykll/)
