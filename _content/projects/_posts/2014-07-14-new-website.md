subtitle: Web design after three years.

This website has been redesigned from the ground-up, after lying dormant for many years. The new website is better-designed, leverages modern techniques in web development and has room for expansion.

Documentation and source code is available [on github](https://github.com/gauravmm/gauravmanek.com/). I have also written about some of the tools and techniques that I used to build this site:

- [Building with Gulp]({% post_url 2014-07-20-building-with-gulp %})

- [Deploying static sites]({% post_url 2014-07-25-deploying-sites %})
{% endcomment %}
- [Making websites faster]({% post_url 2014-07-27-faster-websites %})
- [Templating with Jekyll]({% post_url 2014-07-16-templating-with-jeykll %})
