From January 2015 to April 2016, I was the systems administrator for [WeScheme](http://www.wescheme.org/), an online programming environment for a dialect of Scheme. It is associated with [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/), which is an educational initiative that brings basic computer science education to high school students.

In my time as systems administrator, I:
  - managed the compiler server infrastructure,
  - migrated from server-side compilation to the current client-side system,
  - tested and migrated the underlying data storage system,
  - wrote small patches, and ---
  - investigated and documented bugs.

I handed over my responsibilities in April 2016, just before my graduation.
