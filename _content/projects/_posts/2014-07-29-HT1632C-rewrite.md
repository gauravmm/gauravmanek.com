title: Rewriting HT1632C for Arduino
subtitle: Improving memory efficiency and code readability.
---

This is a powerful library that allows an Arduino to interface with the popular Holtek HT1632C LED driver. It allows programmers to directly perform advanced drawing of images and text with minimal code. [See the project on GitHub](https://github.com/gauravmm/HT1632-for-Arduino).

This rewrite affects the format of images, fonts and buffers. Key improvements include:

__Memory Use__: Images, fonts and buffers are smaller, with a minimum 50% reduction in size. Each byte holds data for 8 pixels now, up from 4.
__Font Definitions__: Fonts now store indices instead of widths - this removed the memory alignment requirements and reduces font sizes by a further 25%.
__Speed__ and __Size__: Drawing is faster, the inner loop of the copying engine has been rewritten.
__Code Quality__: The inner loop of the copying engine uses a much more simplified and general copying engine that uses simple, well-commented operations instead of bit-bashing.
__Tools__: Existing tools updated and new tools created. Migration tools make upgrading easy.
