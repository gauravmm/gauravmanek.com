## 3D Minesweeper
Its Minesweeper! In 3D!

Available to anyone who bothers to update their browsers, this takes advantage of the new `<canvas>` tag to render an Anaglyph-3D (using red-cyan glasses) version of minesweeper. Play it here.

Technical Information: There are two display methods available. index_Canvas.html uses the canvas tag, while index_DOM.html uses DOM manipulation (specifically, a Javascript generated table). Both files make use of the same code in game.js.

## pmOAS

A simple, configurable, Optical Answer Sheet (OAS) solution that anyone can use.

Designed for students and teachers who do not have access to automated MCQ scanners and markers, this software can quickly read shaded answers off the provided optical answer sheets. Simply print an OAS (sample PDF provided below), and use a digital camera to take photos of the completed sheets. The pmOAS software will read the answers and produce an Excel-compatible file with answers and scores automatically marked.

This project is currently not ready for release. Contact me if you would like to beta-test it.
