# 3D Photography

Capturing images in stereo with two Nikon D7000s mounted on a DIY rig. Pairs of images were aligned and stitched into an anaglyph image.

# 3D Minesweeper
Its Minesweeper! In 3D!

Available to anyone who bothers to update their browsers, this takes advantage of the new `<canvas>` tag to render an Anaglyph-3D (using red-cyan glasses) version of minesweeper. Play it [here](/stuff/3dminesweeper/index_Canvas.html).

Technical Information: There are two display methods available. index_Canvas.html uses the canvas tag, while index_DOM.html uses DOM manipulation (specifically, a JavaScript generated table). Both files make use of the same code in game.js.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/gauravmm/HTML5-3D-Minesweeper).



# Heads-Up Display

Using two OLED screens, a partial mirror, and a Fresnel lens, I was able to render arbitrary images floating in front of your eyes. The entire assembly was mounted on a baseball cap.

# Smoke Photography

Clever arrangement of lights and fans yielded beautiful images of smoke, in laminar and turbulent flow.
