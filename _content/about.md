I'm Gaurav Manek. 

I graduated from Brown University with B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science in Spring 2016, after three years of study. While in Brown, I worked in [Dr. Stefanie Tellex's](http://cs.brown.edu/~stefie10/) [Humans to Robots laboratory](http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) for two years, eventually writing my [honors thesis on parsing prepositional statements incrementally](https://github.com/gauravmm/Brown-Honors-Thesis/releases).

While at Brown, I volunteered for two and a half years at the Brown [Sexual Health Awareness Group (SHAG)](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/shag) as a peer counsellor, responding to individual queries as well as organizing campus-wide events for undergraduate students. I was also the first Technology House ombusperson, acting as a chaplain, paracounsellor, and mediator for a group of around sixty people.

Now that I'm back in Singapore, I am working as a research engineer for [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), who do not endorse any content on this site. 

In my free time, I [build things](/projects/), [write about building things](/blog/), and occasionally [bake](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/ASCII_cake.jpg). I speak Hindi, Kutchi, and (halting) American Sign Language. I have also learnt to [crack a bullwhip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-IAWn2YdVo).
