Hi!

I'm Gaurav Manek. 

I'm an undergraduate student at Brown University, reading Computer Science. I have research experience with the [Institute for Infocomm Research](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/) in Singapore.

In my free time, I [build things](/projects/), [write about building things](/blog/) and learn American Sign Language. I've also been [learning to use a bullwhip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-IAWn2YdVo).

You can [connect with me on LinkedIn](http://sg.linkedin.com/in/gauravmanek), [see what I've been writing on GitHub](https://github.com/gauravmm), or [send me an email](mailto:gaurav@gauravmanek.com).
