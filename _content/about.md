I'm Gaurav Manek, a PhD candidate advised by [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/) at Carnegie Mellon University since Fall 2017.

In my free time, I [build things](/projects/), [write about building things](/blog/), and occasionally [bake](http://cooking.gauravmanek.com/). I speak Hindi and (halting) American Sign Language. I have also learnt to [crack a bullwhip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-IAWn2YdVo).

Previously, I was working as a research engineer for [A*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), in the [Deep Learning 2.0](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r/RESEARCH/DEEP-LEARNING) lab, with [Vijay Chandrasekhar](http://vijaychan.github.io/).

I graduated from Brown University with B.Sc. (Hons) in Computer Science in Spring 2016. While in Brown, I worked in [Dr. Stefanie Tellex's](http://cs.brown.edu/~stefie10/) [Humans to Robots laboratory](http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/) for two years, eventually writing my [honors thesis on parsing prepositional statements incrementally](https://github.com/gauravmm/Brown-Honors-Thesis/releases).

You can [connect with me on LinkedIn](http://sg.linkedin.com/in/gauravmanek), [see what I've been writing on GitHub](https://github.com/gauravmm), or [send me an email](mailto:gaurav@gauravmanek.com).
